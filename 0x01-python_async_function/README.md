# Python Async Function Project

This project demonstrates the use of asynchronous programming in Python, focusing on coroutines, tasks, and performance measurement.

## Files:

1. `0-basic_async_syntax.py`: Contains a basic async coroutine.
2. `1-concurrent_coroutines.py`: Demonstrates running multiple coroutines concurrently.
3. `2-measure_runtime.py`: Measures the runtime of async operations.
4. `3-tasks.py`: Introduces the concept of asyncio Tasks.
5. `4-tasks.py`: Implements a task-based version of the concurrent coroutines.
